Operational Software for any fablab or makerspace

FabApp was designed as a scaleable system to address the specific needs of the UTA FabLab, built as an open source project to address the needs of our FabLab and makerspaces around the world. This system is the underlying software that supports OctoPuppet(3D printing management) and JuiceBox(an access control device for anything). [Together](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzhfhIHqhlx1ekFxRVc0VTBLRHc) this allows an organization to monitor all equipment, mediate equipment access through training requirements, manage inventory, and track/store completed objects for its users.

This is a project in progress and will continue to have additional functionality added over time. Currently, we are under development and on V1.0.  Please stay tuned and in touch as this project reaches maturity!  For additional information please visit [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzhfhIHqhlx1WldacWF0d3lkYWs) concerning additional information for both end-users and developers.
